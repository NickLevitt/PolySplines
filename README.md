# R-Shiny Visualization of Polynomial Splines
## Nick Levitt and Alex Jacobs

This is an R-Shiny application for the visualization of polynomial splines. 
The UI allows for the user to select between either the mtCars data or randomly generated data, as well as selecting the number of datapoints to display, the number of knots for the spline, and the degree of the polynomial.
